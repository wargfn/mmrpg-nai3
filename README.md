Marvel Multiverse Narrator AI 2

## CLI configuration

The narrator CLI supports Open WebUI and can load settings from a TOML file, environment variables, or CLI flags.

- Copy `narrator_config.toml.example` to `narrator_config.toml`
- Edit `[open_webui]` values:
  - `host`
  - `model`
  - `api_key`
  - `timeout`
  - `llm_timeout_ms`
- Edit `[session]` values:
  - `max_history_turns`
  - `summarization_interval`

### Config precedence

1. CLI flags: `--model`, `--host`, `--api-key`, `--timeout`
2. Environment: `NARRATOR_MODEL`, `NARRATOR_OPEN_WEBUI_HOST`, `NARRATOR_API_KEY`, `NARRATOR_TIMEOUT`
3. Config file: `--config <path>` or `./narrator_config.toml`
4. Defaults: model `qwen2.5:14b-instruct`, host `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, timeout `120`

### Open WebUI host behavior

- The CLI sends chat requests to `<host>/api/chat/completions`.
- You can set `host` to a base URL like `http://localhost:3000` or to a custom base path.
- Use `--timeout`, `NARRATOR_TIMEOUT`, `[open_webui].timeout`, or `[open_webui].llm_timeout_ms` to control HTTP request timeouts.
- On startup, the CLI injects persisted SQLite campaign memories from `data/campaign.db` into the initial system prompt so the model begins with prior session continuity.
- Live chat prompts keep the system context at the head, send only the most recent configured active turns, and periodically summarize older dialogue into a persistent `Previous Campaign Events` block stored in SQLite.
- Before each freeform prompt is sent to the model, the session controller now prepends relevant local context blocks from active character sheets, `data/*.json`, campaign plans/memories, and optional notebook exports stored under `marvel_mcp_narrator/data/notebooks/`.
- Exact rule and notebook keyword hits are injected as automated citation blocks immediately above the active chat history so smaller local models can quote mechanics without tool-calling.

## Discord bot

The repository also includes a Discord interface that mirrors the shared `GameSessionController` backend used by the CLI.

- Install dependencies and set `NARRATOR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` (preferred); `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is supported as a fallback alias.
- Optionally add a `[discord]` block to `narrator_config.toml`:
  - `command_prefix` (or `NARRATOR_DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX`)
  - `campaign_channel_id` (or `NARRATOR_DISCORD_CAMPAIGN_CHANNEL_ID`; required to enable freeform narration)
  - `history_limit` (or `NARRATOR_DISCORD_HISTORY_LIMIT`)
  - `token` (environment variables are preferred for secrets)
- Start the bot with `marvel-narrator-discord` or `python -m marvel_mcp_narrator.interfaces.discord_bot`.
- Supported environment variables are `NARRATOR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` (preferred), `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` (fallback alias), `NARRATOR_DISCORD_CAMPAIGN_CHANNEL_ID`, `NARRATOR_DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX`, and `NARRATOR_DISCORD_HISTORY_LIMIT`.
- You can also pass `--token <discord-bot-token>`, `--campaign-channel-id <channel-id>`, `--model <model>`, `--host <url>`, `--base-url <url>`, `--api-key <key>`, and `--timeout <seconds>` on the command line; these override environment variables and config file values.
- To run it as a detached background service, use `marvel-narrator-discord --background --token <discord-bot-token> --campaign-channel-id <channel-id> --host <url> --model <model> --timeout <seconds> --log-file /path/to/discord.log --pid-file /path/to/discord.pid`.
- Run `!sync-commands` once from a Discord server administrator account to sync slash commands when needed.
- Text-command parsing accepts both the configured prefix (default `!`) and `/`, so CLI-style entries like `/roll`, `/rules`, `/memories`, `/combat`, `/attack`, `/npc-attack`, and `/help` are routed as commands instead of freeform narration.
- The bot supports hybrid slash/text commands for:
  - `/roll` with arguments `edges`, `troubles`, and `modifier` (text form: `!roll [edges] [troubles] [modifier]`)
  - `/rule` with argument `query` (text form: `!rule <query>`)
  - `/combat status`
  - `/attack` with arguments `target`, `rank`, and `marvel_die` (text form: `!attack <target> <rank> <marvel_die>`)
  - `/clear_history [limit]` (text form: `!clear [limit]`) clears recent non-pinned messages in the active channel or thread
- Natural messages are only forwarded when `campaign_channel_id` is configured; otherwise slash/text commands still work, but freeform narration is disabled.
- Each Discord user gets an isolated game session, character roster, combat tracker, and conversation history.
- A freeform prompt in the configured campaign channel is automatically routed into that user's dedicated Discord thread.
- Discord freeform narration uses the same prompt-specific context injector as the CLI, so notebook notes, campaign summaries, and relevant rules/character data are prepended automatically before the sliding chat window.

## FastMCP narrator server

- Start the FastMCP narrator server with `python -m marvel_mcp_narrator.mcp_servers.narrator_tools`.
- List exposed tools with `python -m marvel_mcp_narrator.mcp_servers.narrator_tools --list-tools`.
- To run it as a detached background service, use `python -m marvel_mcp_narrator.mcp_servers.narrator_tools --background --log-file /path/to/narrator-tools.log --pid-file /path/to/narrator-tools.pid`.

## CLI commands and shutdown

- Run `marvel-narrator-cli --help` to see CLI flags and interactive command help.
- During a session:
  - `/help` shows the available commands
  - `/roll [edges] [troubles]` or `/roll [--edges N] [--troubles N] [--tn N]` runs a deterministic d616 roll
  - `/rules <keyword>` or `/rule <keyword>` searches the local rulebook
  - `/attack <attacker> <ability> <target> [manual d616 roll] [--edges N] [--troubles N] [--focus]` resolves a player attack and can ingest manual reports such as `[4, 5, 1 (Marvel)]` where the Marvel die is explicitly marked
  - `/npc-attack <attacker> <ability> <target> [--edges N] [--troubles N] [--focus]` automatically resolves an NPC or enemy action
  - `/combat` shows tracked combatant health/focus state
  - `/memories` prints stored campaign memory entries
  - A plain manual d616 report such as `[4, 5, 1 (Marvel)]` is normalized and added to the session history without calling the model; manual reports must explicitly mark the Marvel die
  - `exit`, `quit`, `/exit`, or `/quit` gracefully shut down the narrator
- Pressing `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+D` also exits the CLI cleanly.
